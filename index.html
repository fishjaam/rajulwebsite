                <h2>Meet Raj</h2>
                <p>Hi I'm Raj! I've played pickleball for 5 years and currently compete in professional pickleball (APP and PPA) tournaments across the country in the qualifying brackets. Last year I participated in events in Austin, Atlanta, Chicago, Vancouver Canada, and Arizona to name a few. My current DUPR rating is 5.55.</p>
                <p>My background is in tennis and I have had a racquet in my hand since I was 5 and played competitively since I was 7 years old. I've played junior tournaments across the country and I was the #1 highschool recruit in Oregon for my grade. I've played all 4 years at the collegiate level.</p>
                <p>I love teaching and working with people, and I take pride in creating a personalized experience for each client. My coaching style is adaptive and tailored to fit individual needs, because I believe no two players learn the same way.</p>

            <div class="services-description">
                <p>At the start of every session, I check in and ask how you'd like to structure our time—whether that's focusing on a specific shot, drilling techniques, or just hitting a lot of balls and playing games. I specialize in helping advanced players take their game to the next level, but I also work with players of all levels if they feel stuck and want to level up.</p>

                        <p>"As a complete beginner, I was intimidated to start pickleball at 58. Raj immediately put me at ease with his patient approach and clear instructions. After just 6 lessons, I'm confidently playing at my local rec center and even won my first casual tournament!"</p>

                        <p>"My 10 and 12-year-old kids were struggling to get into sports until they tried Raj's youth pickleball clinic. His ability to make the lessons fun while teaching proper technique has them begging to play every weekend. They've improved so much and their confidence has soared!"</p>

                        <p>"I was stuck at a 3.5 level for two years before working with Raj. His analysis of my serve and third-shot drop was game-changing. He identified flaws nobody else had pointed out, and within two months I achieved my goal of reaching 4.0. Best investment in my pickleball journey!"</p>

                        <p>"Our senior pickleball group (all 65+) hired Raj for weekly group sessions. His ability to adapt drills to our mobility levels while still pushing us to improve has been remarkable. He's technically excellent but also understands the social aspect that makes pickleball special for us."</p>

                        <p>"As a former tennis player transitioning to pickleball, I kept making the same mistakes. Raj's background in both sports was perfect - he helped me adapt my tennis strokes and footwork to pickleball's unique requirements. His video analysis and customized drills fast-tracked my progress tremendously."</p>
